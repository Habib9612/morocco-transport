**Linting Process Isolation Test Log**

**Objective:** To determine if the `npm run lint` failure (error: "Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution. This is unexpected. All changes to the repo have been rolled back.") is due to an issue with a specific file, an aggregation of many file errors, or a more global problem with the linting setup/environment.

**Step 1: Identify a simple, known-good TypeScript file.**
*   File selected: `lib/utils.ts`. This file was confirmed to exist via `ls lib/`.

**Step 2: Attempt to lint the single file.**
*   **Command Executed:** `npx eslint lib/utils.ts`
*   **Outcome:** Failed.
*   **Error Message:** "Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution. This is unexpected. All changes to the repo have been rolled back."

**Analysis of Outcome:**
*   The attempt to lint a single, presumably simple utility file (`lib/utils.ts`) resulted in the exact same critical failure mode as when running `npm run lint` (which lints the entire project).
*   This indicates that the problem is **not specific to the content of the files being linted or an aggregation of errors from multiple files.**
*   The failure occurs even when invoking ESLint directly via `npx eslint` on a single file.

**Conclusion & Summary of Findings:**
The persistent failure mode ("Failed to compute affected file count...") when attempting to lint even a single, simple TypeScript file suggests:
1.  **Global Issue:** The problem is likely global, related to the ESLint configuration itself, its dependencies, the way `npx` executes it, or fundamental incompatibilities within the `run_in_bash_session` execution environment.
2.  **Not File-Specific:** The error is not triggered by the content of the files being linted (or at least, not *solely* by that, as even a simple file fails in the same way).
3.  **Tooling/Environment Problem:** This points towards a deeper issue with the tooling setup or the execution environment provided by the sandbox, which prevents ESLint from operating correctly at a fundamental level. The rollback behavior associated with this error is particularly problematic for any diagnostic or fixing attempts.

Further attempts to lint other specific files or directories are unlikely to yield different results until this core execution error for ESLint (and other npm scripts like `npm audit`) is resolved.
