# Resource Usage Analysis Report (Memory & CPU)

This report analyzes potential concerns related to memory and CPU usage within the MarocTransit platform, based on a review of the codebase.

## 1. Memory Usage

**a. Server-Side Memory:**

*   **Critical Issue: Lack of Pagination in API List Endpoints:**
    *   **Files:** `app/api/shipments/route.ts`, `app/api/drivers/route.ts`, `app/api/locations/route.ts`, `app/api/routes/route.ts`, `app/api/trucks/route.ts`, and corresponding server actions in `app/actions/`.
    *   **Problem:** All endpoints that fetch lists of data (e.g., all shipments, all trucks) currently retrieve all matching records from the database without any pagination (e.g., using `SELECT * FROM ...` or `SELECT s.* FROM ...`).
    *   **Impact:** As the number of records in the database tables grows, these endpoints will load the entire dataset into the Node.js server's memory for each request. This will lead to:
        *   **High Memory Consumption:** Potentially causing the server to run out of memory, especially under concurrent load or with very large tables.
        *   **Increased Garbage Collection (GC) Pressure:** Frequent allocation and deallocation of large data arrays will trigger more GC cycles, consuming CPU and potentially pausing application execution.
        *   **Slow API Responses:** Serializing very large JSON payloads is also memory and CPU intensive and slow to transmit.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement pagination **urgently** for all API endpoints that return lists. Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` (or cursor-based pagination) in database queries to fetch data in manageable chunks.

*   **Dependency Impact:**
    *   As noted in `dependency_audit_report.md`, `package.json` lists an unusually large number of database-related dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** If many of these libraries are loaded by the Node.js application, they contribute to its overall static and runtime memory footprint, even if not all are actively used in every request.
    *   **Recommendation:** Audit and remove unused dependencies to reduce the application's baseline memory usage.

*   **In-Memory Caching:**
    *   No explicit application-level in-memory caching strategies (e.g., LRU cache for frequently accessed data) were observed in the reviewed backend code. While this means no direct memory leaks from custom caches, it also means data is re-fetched from the database on every request, which can increase I/O and database load (addressed in backend performance).

**b. Client-Side Memory:**

*   **Chat Message Storage (`components/chat.tsx`):**
    *   Chat messages are loaded from `localStorage` and stored in React state (`useState<Message[]>`).
    *   **Impact:** For very long chat conversations, holding all messages in JavaScript memory could lead to high memory usage within the browser tab, potentially degrading performance or causing crashes on memory-constrained devices.
    *   **Recommendation:** For displaying long lists like chat messages, implement list virtualization to only render visible items. Consider strategies for archiving or paginating older messages rather than loading an entire unbounded history from `localStorage`.

**c. Potential Memory Leaks (Resource Cleanup):**

*   **WebSocket Context (`lib/websocket-context.tsx`):**
    *   The `WebSocketProvider` correctly uses a cleanup function in `useEffect` to close the WebSocket connection when the provider unmounts (`socket.close()`). This should prevent leaks related to the WebSocket object itself.
    *   The auto-reconnect logic using `setTimeout` appears to be managed within the lifecycle of the `connect` callback and `useEffect`, reducing the risk of orphaned timeouts if the main provider unmounts.
*   **General Event Listeners/Subscriptions:**
    *   No obvious patterns of creating global event listeners or subscriptions without corresponding cleanup functions were observed in the reviewed files. React's component lifecycle and `useEffect` cleanup are generally used.
*   **Conclusion:** Based on the reviewed files, the risk of memory leaks from uncleaned resources like WebSocket connections appears relatively low, assuming components unmount correctly. The primary memory concerns are related to handling large datasets.

## 2. CPU Usage

**a. Server-Side CPU:**

*   **JSON Serialization/Deserialization for Large Datasets:**
    *   Linked to the lack of pagination, when API endpoints return very large arrays of objects, the process of serializing this data to JSON (`NextResponse.json(...)`) can be CPU-intensive. Similarly, handling large JSON request bodies would also consume CPU.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to slower response times and increased server load.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implementing pagination will significantly reduce the size of JSON payloads and thus the CPU overhead for serialization.

*   **Password Hashing (`bcryptjs`):**
    *   Used in `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` and `app/actions/auth.ts`.
    *   **Impact:** `bcryptjs` is intentionally CPU-intensive to protect against brute-force attacks. This is a necessary security measure. Under extremely high signup volume, this could become a CPU bottleneck, but this is a standard characteristic of secure password hashing.
    *   **Recommendation:** This is generally acceptable. For very high-scale systems, dedicated auth services or rate limiting on signup might be considered.

*   **Complex Computations:**
    *   No significant CPU-intensive algorithms or computations were identified directly within the reviewed Node.js backend code. The primary AI/ML logic is appropriately offloaded to a separate Python service, which is a good design choice for keeping the Node.js event loop unblocked.

**b. Client-Side CPU:**

*   **`localStorage` Operations for Chat (`components/chat.tsx`):**
    *   `JSON.parse()` when loading messages and `JSON.stringify()` when saving messages are synchronous operations.
    *   **Impact:** If chat histories stored in `localStorage` become very large, these operations can block the main browser thread, leading to UI jank and unresponsiveness.
    *   **Recommendation:** Optimize chat message storage. If `localStorage` must be used, consider strategies to reduce the amount of data processed at once (e.g., incremental loading/saving, only keeping recent messages in active memory and `localStorage`, with older messages archived or fetched on demand if a backend store is introduced).

*   **Rendering Large Lists (Conceptual):**
    *   As noted in the frontend performance analysis, rendering very long lists (e.g., chat messages, table data if not paginated) without virtualization can be CPU-intensive for the browser due to DOM manipulation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement list virtualization for potentially long lists.

## 3. Recommendations for Resource Usage Optimization

1.  **Implement Pagination Everywhere:** This is the most critical step to control server-side memory and CPU usage for list endpoints, and also improves client-side performance by reducing data transfer.
2.  **Audit and Minimize Dependencies:** Remove unused dependencies (especially the numerous database clients) from `package.json` to reduce the application's baseline memory footprint.
3.  **Optimize Client-Side Chat Storage:** Re-evaluate the use of `localStorage` for large chat histories. Consider backend storage and client-side virtualization/pagination for messages.
4.  **Continue Offloading Intensive Computations:** Maintain the pattern of offloading CPU-intensive tasks like AI model processing to separate services (like the Python API) to keep the Node.js backend responsive.
5.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** In production, monitor server memory and CPU usage to identify actual bottlenecks under real load. Use profiling tools for both backend and frontend as needed.
