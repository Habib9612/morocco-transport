# JWT Secret Hardening and Reset-Password Scaffolding Report

This document details the measures taken to strengthen JWT secret handling and the initial scaffolding of reset-password functionality.

## 1. JWT Secret Handling Hardening

**Issue Identified:**
Previously, JWT signing and verification operations (e.g., in `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/session/route.ts`, and subsequently in shipment APIs) used a fallback to a hardcoded default secret (`'your-secret-key'`) if the `process.env.JWT_SECRET` environment variable was not set. This is a critical security vulnerability.

**Modifications Made:**
The following files were modified to ensure that the application does not operate with a weak or default JWT secret:
*   `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
*   `app/api/auth/session/route.ts`
*   `app/api/shipments/route.ts` (for both GET and POST handlers)
*   `app/api/shipments/[id]/route.ts` (for GET, PUT, and DELETE handlers)

**Changes Implemented in each relevant JWT operation (sign or verify):**
```typescript
// Example from app/api/auth/login/route.ts (for signing)
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!jwtSecret) {
  console.error('CRITICAL: JWT_SECRET is not defined. Authentication cannot proceed securely.');
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server configuration error.' }, { status: 500 });
}
const token = sign({ userId: user.id }, jwtSecret, { expiresIn: '7d' });

// Example from app/api/auth/session/route.ts (for verification)
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!jwtSecret) {
  console.error('CRITICAL: JWT_SECRET is not defined. Session verification cannot proceed securely.');
  return NextResponse.json({ user: null, error: 'Server configuration error' }); // Or appropriate error for context
}
decoded = verify(sessionCookie.value, jwtSecret) as { userId: string };
```
For API routes where verification happens as part of an auth check (e.g., shipment APIs), the missing `jwtSecret` now causes an error to be thrown, which is caught by the authentication error handling block, typically resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error response, preventing insecure operation.

**Impact:**
The application will now fail explicitly (and log a critical error server-side) if the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is not configured, rather than silently falling back to an insecure default. This significantly improves the security posture regarding token integrity.

## 2. Reset-Password Functionality Scaffolding

Basic API route scaffolding for a two-step password reset process was created.

**a. Request Password Reset:**
*   **File Created:** `app/api/auth/reset-password/request/route.ts`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Defines a `POST` handler expecting an `email` in the request body.
    *   Uses Zod for basic email format validation.
    *   **Conceptual Logic (commented in the file):**
        1.  Find a user by the provided email.
        2.  If user exists, generate a unique, secure, time-limited password reset token.
        3.  Hash the token and store it in the database with an expiry and associated user ID (requires a new `PasswordResetToken` model/table).
        4.  Send an email to the user containing a link with the plain (unhashed) token.
    *   **Current Behavior:** Logs a message server-side and returns a generic success response to the client, regardless of whether the email exists, to prevent user enumeration.

**b. Confirm Password Reset:**
*   **File Created:** `app/api/auth/reset-password/confirm/route.ts`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Defines a `POST` handler expecting a `token` and `newPassword` in the request body.
    *   Uses Zod for basic validation of these fields.
    *   **Conceptual Logic (commented in the file):**
        1.  Find the password reset token record in the database (potentially by hashing the input token if the stored one is hashed, or by a direct lookup).
        2.  Validate the token's existence and expiry.
        3.  If valid, retrieve the associated user ID.
        4.  Hash the `newPassword`.
        5.  Update the user's password in the `User` table.
        6.  Delete the used password reset token.
    *   **Current Behavior:** Logs the attempt and returns a generic success message. Actual password update logic is not implemented.

*   **Note:** The previously empty file `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts` was not modified by this scaffolding, as new, more specific routes (`request/route.ts` and `confirm/route.ts`) were created. This empty file might need to be deleted or repurposed.

## 3. Remaining Concerns and Next Steps

*   **JWT Secret Management:** The `JWT_SECRET` environment variable must be securely generated and managed in all deployment environments.
*   **Full Reset-Password Implementation:**
    *   A new Prisma model (e.g., `PasswordResetToken`) needs to be created to store tokens, user associations, and expiry dates.
    *   The conceptual logic for token generation, storage, email sending, token validation, and password updating needs to be fully implemented.
    *   Secure email templating and delivery mechanisms are required.
    *   Frontend pages for requesting the reset and submitting the new password with the token are needed.
*   **Error Handling:** While JWT secret handling is now more robust, ensure all error paths in the new reset password functionality are handled gracefully, logging details server-side without exposing sensitive information to clients.
*   **Testing:** Due to the ongoing tooling/environment blockers, these changes (JWT secret checks and new API routes) have not been tested. Thorough testing will be essential once the environment is stable.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the "request password reset" endpoint to prevent abuse (e.g., an attacker spamming users with reset emails or probing for valid email addresses).
