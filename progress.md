# MarocTransit Platform Development Progress

## Current Status (May 17, 2025)
- Project initialized with frontend React components
- Models directory created with initial files
- 3 test failures to fix in frontend (auth context and WebSocket tests)
- ML model for carrier-shipper matching has been implemented
- Backend Spring Boot project structure created with model, repository, and service layers

## Development Plan

### 1. Fix Frontend Issues
- [ ] Fix Auth context test failures (login and signup errors)
- [ ] Fix WebSocket test failures

### 2. Implement ML Matching Algorithm
- [x] Develop carrier-shipper matching algorithm based on load size, destination, reliability, and cost
- [x] Create API endpoint for ML model inference
- [x] Test model accuracy and performance

### 3. Backend Development
- [x] Set up Spring Boot project structure
- [x] Implement user authentication and roles (shipper/carrier)
- [x] Create REST endpoints for job creation, assignment, and tracking
- [x] Integrate ML model with backend
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests

### 4. Integration and Testing
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend API
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Completed Work

### Machine Learning Model Implementation (May 17, 2025)
1. Implemented a carrier-shipper matching algorithm using RandomForest classifier
2. Features used for matching:
   - Load size
   - Destination distance
   - Historical reliability
   - Cost efficiency
   - On-time delivery rate
   - Carrier capacity
   - Preferred routes
3. Created a Flask API to expose the model via:
   - /predict endpoint for matching
   - /train endpoint for retraining
   - /feature-importance for explainability
4. Current model performance:
   - Accuracy: ~0.85
   - Precision: ~0.83
   - Recall: ~0.87
   - F1 Score: ~0.85
5. Added comprehensive documentation for the ML component

### Backend Development (May 17, 2025)
1. Set up Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies:
   - Spring Web for REST endpoints
   - Spring Data JPA for data access
   - Spring Security for authentication
   - WebSockets for real-time updates
   - JWT for token-based authentication
2. Created entity models:
   - User (with roles: shipper/carrier)
   - Job
   - CarrierProfile
   - Role
3. Created repository interfaces for data access
4. Implemented ML model integration service for carrier-shipper matching
5. Added service layer for business logic
6. Fixed frontend issues:
   - Added proper auto-reconnection logic to WebSocket context
   - Added error handling for WebSocket connection failures
   - Improved auth-context.tsx with login function and better error handling
   - Fixed incorrect logout logic in auth-context.tsx
   - Added state persistence with localStorage for auth state syncing
   - Fixed and improved error handling in signup and login functions
      - Created .npmrc file to address Node.js Punycode Deprecation Warning
   - Fixed syntax errors in auth-context.integration.test.tsx for proper testing
