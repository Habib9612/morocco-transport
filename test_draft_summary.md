# Test Draft Summary

This document summarizes the modules and components for which unit tests were drafted, along with a brief description of the test coverage achieved for each.

## 1. `lib/utils.ts` (for `cn` function)

*   **Test File:** `lib/utils.test.ts`
*   **Coverage Description:**
    *   Covered various input types including basic strings, conditional class names (objects), and mixed arrays of strings and objects.
    *   Tested handling of falsy values such as `null`, `undefined`, and empty strings to ensure they are gracefully ignored.
    *   Included a conceptual test for `tailwind-merge` behavior to ensure class overriding and merging logic (as handled by the `cn` function's dependencies) works as expected.
    *   Assessed complex combinations of different input types.

## 2. `lib/auth.ts` (for `getAuthUser`, `isAuthenticated`, `hasRole` functions)

*   **Test File:** `lib/auth.test.ts`
*   **Coverage Description:**
    *   Focused on the cookie parsing logic within `getAuthUser`, assuming `next/headers` `cookies()` function (and `NextRequest` cookies) can be mocked.
    *   Covered scenarios with a valid "user" cookie, ensuring correct parsing and return of the user object.
    *   Tested behavior with a malformed (invalid JSON) "user" cookie, ensuring graceful error handling (returns null, logs error).
    *   Ensured `null` is returned when the "user" cookie is missing.
    *   Checked that defaults are applied for missing fields within a valid JSON cookie.
    *   Included tests for `isAuthenticated` and `hasRole` to verify their logic based on the output of the (mocked) `getAuthUser`.

## 3. `components/ui/button.tsx` (for `Button` component)

*   **Test File:** `components/ui/button.test.tsx`
*   **Coverage Description:**
    *   Utilized `@testing-library/react` patterns for component interaction and assertion.
    *   Covered basic rendering of the button with default props and children content.
    *   Tested the application of different `variant` and `size` props, conceptually verifying that corresponding styles/classes would be applied.
    *   Ensured the `onClick` event handler is correctly called when the button is clicked.
    *   Verified the behavior of the `disabled` prop, ensuring the button is actually disabled and does not fire `onClick`.
    *   Tested the `asChild` prop, confirming the component can render as a different underlying HTML element (e.g., an `<a>` tag) while retaining button styling.
