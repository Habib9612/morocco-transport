**`npm outdated` Execution Log**

**Objective:** To check for outdated dependencies as part of the dependency analysis.

**Attempt to run `npm outdated`:**
*   **Command Executed:** `npm outdated`
*   **Outcome:** Failed.
*   **Error Message:** "Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution. This is unexpected. All changes to the repo have been rolled back."

**Analysis of Outcome:**
*   The attempt to run `npm outdated` resulted in the exact same critical failure mode as previously encountered with `npm run lint`, `npm audit`, and `npx eslint`.
*   This consistent failure across multiple `npm` commands strongly suggests a fundamental issue within the `run_in_bash_session` execution environment, particularly when these commands need to analyze the project's dependency tree or file structure.

**Conclusion & Summary of Findings:**
*   Automated checking for outdated dependencies using `npm outdated` is **not possible** due to the persistent global execution error.
*   This reinforces the findings from `critical_tooling_blockers.md` and `lint_isolation_log.txt`: there appears to be a systemic problem with how `npm` commands operate within this specific sandboxed environment, leading to an inability to perform essential package management and code quality checks.
*   The rollback behavior associated with this error further complicates any diagnostic efforts.

Without a resolution to this core execution environment problem, standard Node.js project commands for assessing dependency status, linting, and auditing cannot be reliably executed.
