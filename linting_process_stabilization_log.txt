**Linting Process Stabilization Log**

**Objective:** Attempt to achieve a stable execution of `npm run lint`.

**Initial Attempt - `npm run lint`:**
*   **Command:** `npm run lint`
*   **Outcome:** Failed
*   **Error Message:** "Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution. This is unexpected. All changes to the repo have been rolled back."
*   **Analysis:** This is a persistent critical error that prevents any linting analysis and also reverts changes, making iterative fixes difficult.

**Attempt to Exclude Problematic Files from Linting:**

1.  **Check for `.eslintignore`:**
    *   Used `ls()` to check for an existing `.eslintignore` file.
    *   **Outcome:** No `.eslintignore` file was found in the project root.

2.  **Create `.eslintignore`:**
    *   Created a new `.eslintignore` file.
    *   Added the following paths to the ignore file, as these files have colons in their names and have proven unmanageable with other tools:
        ```
        components/components:error-boundary.tsx.ts
        lib/lib:auth-context.integration.test.tsx.ts
        ```
    *   **Outcome:** File `.eslintignore` created successfully.

3.  **Re-run `npm run lint` after creating `.eslintignore`:**
    *   **Command:** `npm run lint`
    *   **Outcome:** Failed
    *   **Error Message:** "Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution. This is unexpected. All changes to THE REPO HAVE BEEN ROLLED BACK." (Same error as the initial attempt)
    *   **Analysis:** Adding the problematic files to `.eslintignore` did not prevent the linting process itself from failing. This suggests the issue is not with ESLint trying to parse these specific files, but rather a more fundamental problem with the `npm run lint` command's execution environment or its interaction with the file system state within the sandbox.

**Summary of Findings:**
*   The primary blocker for linting is the "Failed to compute affected file count and total size..." error, which occurs when `npm run lint` is executed via `run_in_bash_session`.
*   This error is critical as it not only prevents linting but also rolls back any changes made in the session (like creating `.eslintignore`).
*   Excluding known problematic files (those with colons) via `.eslintignore` did not resolve this underlying execution failure.
*   Further investigation into the cause of this specific `run_in_bash_session` error with `npm run lint` is required. The current tools and methods are insufficient to stabilize the linting process.
